            <h3>For the focaccia:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups (350g) lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For the topping:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil, for brushing on top</li>
                <li>10 ounces brie, cut into cubes (scrape rind off with a paring knife if desired, though it's not
                    necessary)
                </li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all
                the
                dough
                ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I
                sometimes
                knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour.</blockquote>
